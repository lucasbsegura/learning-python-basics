#Unlike languages like C,CPP.. we can use else for loops. When the loop 
# condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part in "else" is 
# executed. If a break statement is executed inside the for loop then the 
# "else" part is skipped. Note that the "else" part is executed even if 
# there is a continue statement.

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i % 5 == 0:

else:
    print("this is not printed because for loop is terminated " +
            "because of break but not due to fail in condition")
